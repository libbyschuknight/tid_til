# Go Surf and Rails

### Aim - to create a Rails app and document what I do and why

## Step 1 - Plan
Make a rough plan of what you what to do.
![plan](images/go_surf.JPG)

This plan has a bit of sketch of what start of home page and then my thinking what tables and fields I need.

My first iteration is going to be:
- Surf Spot
  - name
  - description
  - coordinates
  - place
  - region
  - country
  - stoke_rating
  - photo

I will make one model - `SurfSpot` with 8 fields/attributes.

## Step 2 - create a new Rails app
