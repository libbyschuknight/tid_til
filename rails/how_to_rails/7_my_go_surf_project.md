#### Git Branches
Now that I have the basic app set up I am going to aim to create new branches in git for anything new I add.
This will be useful to play around with different things and also will mean that the master branch can stay "clean".
Which means that if I make a big mistake in a branch, I still have a nice clean, up to date, working branch and it will also make it nicer and easier to deploy.
