Rails
web application vs web framework

server/database vs static
uses Ruby
open source


to start new project need ruby and rails installed

```bash
rails new <app name>
```

sets up structure of app but not really any content

gem - are libraries, like Nuggets, npm packages

familiar with command line??

into app folder
readme
- generally would update this to be relevant to your project

gemfile
- quick explanation of what they are, swapping things out eg database

gitignore
-

went through what some of the files are
did scaffold of posts
showed the files that this created
talked about the migration file
column types
add attributes in migration - asked people for attributes
run Migrations
`rake db:migrate:status`
rollback?
start server - spits out logs
show site
go to post/new page
create new - need controller
