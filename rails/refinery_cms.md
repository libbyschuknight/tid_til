### [Guides](http://www.refinerycms.com/guides)
These are pretty good once I got my head around them being out of date:
>This guide is based on Refinery CMS 2.1.0 so some of the code shown here may not work in earlier versions of Refinery.

and the most up to date version of Rails being 5, but Refinery not working with 5 yet, and having to create a Rails up with an older version of Rails.

Which I realised further down the Getting Started page can be done like this:

```
rails _3.2.15_ new rickrockstar -m http://refinerycms.com/t/2.1.0
```

I did
```
rails _4.2.7.1_ new rickrockstar -m http://refinerycms.com/t/3.0.4
```
as that is the most recent Rails version before 5, and the most up to date RefineryCMS version.
