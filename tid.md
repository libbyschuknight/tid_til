# Today I Did

##### 24 March 2016
Today I have worked on another story for another endpoint in the api that I have been working on. Adding in new facades, representers. Remembering more about database stuff and learning about how frustrating it is when things a coupled together.

##### 23 March 2016
Today I have done/learnt more specs and learnt to think about what is being passed into OpenStructs, how to delete a tag when pushed accidentally.

##### 22 March 2016
Today I have worked on getting my branches of three different things working with changes others have made. There has been an issue with backward compatibility and updating of gems and not of apps using gems.

##### 21 March 2016
Today I have added specs for roles and parties. Created pull requests and tried to make sense of how handle different versions of own gems when more than one person working on them and needing to merge.

##### 20 March 2016

Today I have been working on starting to create my Seido Guide for my karate. I have created a new Rails app, added bootstrap-sass and started developing it from the simple starter them of getbootstrap.com.

##### 18 Mar 2016
Today I did... more disco stuff. Realised was missing conditional in creation of role and party. Updated app using new properties. Broke out logic from facade into a service model, which will make it easier to test this logic. Samson helped me with breaking the conditional logic out into a method, so there would be less branches needed in testing.

Notes from Retro:
- work in breaking out more stories if I think a story I am on it more than one.
- pull requests - need to have a good description, tag people for specific parts of the code, review patterns as well as syntax of code.

Today I did... disco and resources, added in another facade and endpoint. Wrote some new specs. Embedded more understanding of how things interrelate.

##### 16 Mar 2016
Today I did... disco and resources. Added in another representer so as to get links in the embedded property. Update specs.

Today I learnt that it is not always good to be over zealous with merging master into a branch I am on. I was working in an app that used one of our own gems, which someone else had updated. I merged this into my local version of the gem and then it broke some specs in the app I was in. Learnt how to revert from a `git merge master`.

##### 15 March 2016
Today I worked on disco and resources. Continued to fix specs that were failing due to changes. And learnt about hard coding UUIDs into factories. Numerous times I have find this online [Diff Checker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) very useful. It was very useful today.

##### 14 March 2016
Today I worked on disco and Resources. Mainly in netdisco. Adding properties to the representers and fixing up specs due to changes. Good use of factory girl, nested factories. See [Factory Girl](/testing/factory_girl.md)
