... trying to implement State Machine in established code base. Paired for a couple of hours with Samson and implementing the state machine into existing codebase. It was great pairing on this as I firstly wasn't sure how the state machine worked (using State Machines gem) and was at a loss of how to go about implementing in current codebase. In general the things I got for this pairing session were a lot of reminders. Samson was good at making it clear how he was approaching the task at hand. Although we are working on part of a bigger picture, where what we are implementing may effect other parts, he was clear about only focusing on the part we had, at this point. Keeping focused on the story we have to do and doing that and not anything else. He also, at the start, spent time working out exactly what the story was about and clarifying things. He drew out a diagram to get an understanding of where we were and what we wanted to achieve.
