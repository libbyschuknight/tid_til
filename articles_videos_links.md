> A worry junior engineers and new hires frequently have is that they ask too many questions.

> The most common advice I've heard is to try to figure it out yourself for 30 min, and if you're still stuck, ask. This is reasonable advice, but I don't think it's actually very good.

> PSA: when you're building a diverse team, you're looking for culture _add_, not culture _fit_. Hire people who bring a perspective you don't yet have.
