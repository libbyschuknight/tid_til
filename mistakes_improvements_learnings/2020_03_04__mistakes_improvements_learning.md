## ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound being rescued

A change that was made at work, I reviewed the change so when I came across this problem, should I have figured it out? Maybe, although the first test was passing when I first was working on my change. Then the new code was added via merging in master. Maybe I need to pay more attention to changes that I am merging into the code I am working on, which would hopefully mean I might pick things like this up.

When a `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` occurs it is being rescued in the `Api::V3::BaseController` so it will more useful errors for development and testing environments.T

The changes:

```ruby
...

rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :record_not_found

def record_not_found(exception)
  message = safe_env? ? exception.message.to_s : "Not found"

  render json: {
    meta: {
      message: [message],
      status: "error",
      success: false
    }
  }, status: :not_found
end
```

This could cause problems when testing if you are trying to test if an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` has been raised.

For example, with this expect:

```ruby
...
it "raises a 404" do
  $feature[:search_this].disable

  expect { get :index, params: { q: "spectacular" } }.to raise_error(ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound)
end
```

It will fail:

```bash
1) Api::V3::CommunityPosts::SearchController#index without feature enabled raises a 404
     Failure/Error: expect { get :index, params: { q: "spectacular" } }.to raise_error(ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound)
       expected ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound but nothing was raised
```

What will work now is something like this:

```ruby
it "raises a not found error" do
  $feature[:search_this].disable
  get :index, params: { q: "spectacular" }, format: :json

  expect(response).to have_http_status(:not_found)
end
```

## Future proofing against N+1 queries

```ruby
# initial query
Post.joins(:centre).where(groups: {id: current_user.visible_groups})

# in the server output get this sql count
"sql":25,

# addition of includes

Post.includes(:media_items, user: :profile_image).joins(:centre).where(groups: {id: current_user.visible_groups})

# in the server output get this sql count
"sql":21,
```

Doesn't seem like a lot, but this is only in development so a tiny set of data. Probably make a big difference with a lot of data.

## Flipper feature flags and redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/)

[flipper](https://flippercloud.io/)

<https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper>

Had issue with tests failing that had a feature flag and the test env being affected by the dev env locally. I got confused about the dbs and flipper.

Flipper uses redis which affects both the dev and test envs. The dbs do not affect each other

Slack convo:

>Would love someone to sit down with me to help me understand the interaction between the local dev db and the local test db.
>I don't recall this being an issue in other places I have worked as I thought your local development db and the local test db were separate.
>Or it is the fact that I haven't worked with anything like flipper before and the feature flag thing is confusing me? But I wouldn't expect a flag that is enabled in my dev env to affect my test env. or maybe I am overthinking things.

>It's more complex with flipper because the state for it is stored in redis, which isn't unique across dev/test - It probably >wouldn't be hard to fix that though, you'd just add a namespace for the dev environment

>Colleague 1
>Local and test are separateâ€”redis is not. Anything set in redis is kept between test runs and may be set during while you're >developing on your local

## [Action Controller Parameters](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html)

- [permit(*filters)](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-permit)

Was having an issue where this:

```ruby
params.require(:community_post).permit(:content, :announcement,  updated_media_items: [])
```

was returning `updated_media_items` as nothing!

With some help from colleague, we realised we needed to do this:

```ruby
params.require(:community_post).
  permit(:content, :announcement, updated_media_items: [:key, :name, :size, :type, :media_type])
```

## When debugging and using `rails s` and not `foreman`

FYI was having this issue locally

>NOTE: locally I seem to sometimes be able to create a network message and it shows up in the centre community and sometimes not. Let's double check this once it is on staging.

And I have just realised that because I like to use `binding.pry` to debug stuff and you can't use that when using `foreman` so I go back to the `rails s` why of running the server and I also run the `webpack` in another tab. I have just reaslised that there is a job that copies the network message to a com post for centres, so I wasn't seeing it cos the jobs weren't running!! OMG! So much going on! Will add this `bundle exec sidekiq` to my setup for when I want to debug! ðŸ˜±


## Rails normal and API controllers

Hello people. Here is a fun problem. Getting this error when running a spec:
 1) PostsController authorization create Post is a community post sets the status to published
     Failure/Error:
       json[:html]               = render_to_string(
                                     "shared/posts/_post",
                                     layout: false,
                                     locals: { post: @post, single_post: params[:single_post] }
                                   )
     ActionView::MissingTemplate:
       Missing template shared/posts/_post with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:json], :variants=>[], :handlers=>[:raw, :erb, :html, :builder, :ruby, :coffee, :haml]}. Searched in:

         * "/Users/libby/.gem/ruby/2.6.3/gems/devise-4.7.1/app/views"
Have updated the code in the controller to use a CommunityPost::Create use case. Locally works all good. No errors.
But with needing to update the test I needed to add in the use of as: :json as we need to pass in a boolean and not have it be converted to a string (ideally).
And this some how mucks with the spec and makes it think there is no shared/posts/_post, which there is.
1. anyone got any thoughts?
2. anyone want to pair on it? We will time box it.
3. I think I might have a fix but it would involved taking off a validation on the use case?? Thoughts?

Has the partial or test been moved somewhere else? could be that the path no longer exists from that position?

Libby:house_with_garden:  19 minutes ago
Nope, the partial is still there. and number 3 worked to get the test passing.

Libby:house_with_garden:  18 minutes ago
and still works in app so all good

Libby:house_with_garden:  16 minutes ago
I'll try that, I thought all controller actions used format json as a default?

Tim MacDonald  16 minutes ago
Unsure sorry, have you got your changes pushed up? I could try it locally my end and see if I can debug? (edited)

Libby:house_with_garden:  14 minutes ago
yeah think is failing on last commit. but using format json might have fixed it, just checking

Libby:house_with_garden:  13 minutes ago
oh no it didn't, was looking at the wrong thing.

Libby:house_with_garden:  11 minutes ago
hmmmmm

Tim MacDonald  10 minutes ago
Yeh I've got it running locally

Tim MacDonald  10 minutes ago
what is the use case returning?

Libby:house_with_garden:  10 minutes ago
a com post

Ellery Prisk  10 minutes ago
API requests use JSON by default, regular web controllers will stringify all param values

Libby:house_with_garden:  9 minutes ago
yeah I wondered if it was that.....

Libby:house_with_garden:  8 minutes ago
so has to do with our validation on announcement in the use case (edited)

Libby:house_with_garden:  8 minutes ago
perhaps we don't worry about doing that validation?

Libby:house_with_garden:  8 minutes ago
or we remove this tests from the posts controller?

Ellery Prisk  8 minutes ago
Could you make sure announcement is a boolean when passing to the use case?

Libby:house_with_garden:  7 minutes ago
hmmm using !!

Libby:house_with_garden:  6 minutes ago
or maybe something like if params == "true", return true

Libby:house_with_garden:  6 minutes ago
I'm not a fan of the !! (edited)

Libby:house_with_garden:  6 minutes ago
will try it now

Libby:house_with_garden:  6 minutes ago

Tim MacDonald  2 minutes ago
So looks like the use case is returning nil

Libby:house_with_garden:  2 minutes ago
yeah, that is because the validation is failing as from the normal rails controller it passes all params in as strings, but the validtion is checking if it is a boolean. so the create fails, so you don't get a com post from the result

Tim MacDonald  2 minutes ago
Yep sweet

Libby:house_with_garden:  2 minutes ago
Ellerys suggest as worked I think...

Libby:house_with_garden:  < 1 minute ago
silly me, think !! would be best here, as otherwise would need to check "true" and "false" but might leave a comment in the code

Libby:house_with_garden:  < 1 minute ago
or write a really clear commit message

Libby:house_with_garden:  < 1 minute ago
or both

Libby:house_with_garden:  < 1 minute ago
thanks for the help people

Libby:house_with_garden:  < 1 minute ago
going to remember this
API requests use JSON by default, regular web controllers will stringify all param values
