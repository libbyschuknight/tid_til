# Learning and improvements

The aim of this is to have a list of things I have realised I could do to get better, or other people have suggested.

## Read files working in way more carefully, take the time to do this

First story, new job, dived right into it. Was simple, just needed to add some attributes to an JSON output that was being generated. This attribute needed to return `true` or `false`. Thought I had it sorted but it was returning `"true"` or `null`.

It was for a `User` model and a `Group` model. As I was working through this, one of the files was a `concern`. I haven't really worked with Rails concerns before and didn't really pay attention to it.

TODO:

to add

- ootions, code example
- not reading the methods carefully and figuring out exactly what they are doing
- assking for help sooner?? not sure as I think this experience taught me a lot and if I had asked sooner then I might not have had these learnings, don;t think that I wasted too much time on it either, considering what I learn.
