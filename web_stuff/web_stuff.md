## Security

[What is the difference between authentication and authorization?](https://serverfault.com/questions/57077/what-is-the-difference-between-authentication-and-authorization)

> - Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. When you log on to a PC with a user name and password you are authenticating.
> - Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. Gaining access to a resource (e.g. directory on a hard disk) because the permissions configured on it allow you access is authorization.
