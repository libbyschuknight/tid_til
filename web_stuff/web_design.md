>If you get it right, nobody will notice. However if you get it wrong, people will never stop complaining.

>Don't worry! There's a really simple solution. Mock up with 5 different approaches, with whatever you can (post-its are good). Think about it a bit, maybe sleep on it, ask your teammates - and try again. After a few iterations, you'll be feeling much more solid.

>The rule of thumb is to indicate whatever there's less of. If most fields are required, indicate the optional ones. If most fields are optional, indicate what's required.

>Someone who uses your app or website has a particular goal. Often, the one thing standing between the user and their goal is a form. Forms remain one of the most important types of interactions for users on the web and in apps. In fact, forms are often considered the final step in the journey of completing their goals. Forms are just a means to an end. Users should be able to complete them quickly and without confusion.)

>Validation
>Validation should inform users about the correctness of text as soon as the user has inputted the data. The primary principle of good form validation is this: Talk to the user! Tell them what is wrong! Real-time inline validation immediately informs the user about the correctness of their data. This approach allows them to correct any errors faster, without having to wait until they press the “Submit” button to see the errors.

## Buttons
