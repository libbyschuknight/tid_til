## Packages

[The 8 best packages for GitHub's Atom Editor](https://www.customd.com/articles/36/the-8-best-packages-for-githubs-atom-editor)

##### [Git Diff](https://atom.io/packages/git-diff)
Tick on `Show icons in editor gutter`, which will mean you get `+`, `-` etc in colour. Rather then just lines.

#### Adding a Language
A haml file was coming up in plain text, searched for and found [`language-haml`](https://atom.io/packages/language-haml), just installed this package and all sorted.


## Shortcuts that I use a lot and like

`shft + ctrl + ↓` - will add cursor onto multiple lines, like using `cmd + click`

`ctrl + b` - git blame inline

`ctrl + shft + 9` - toggles git staging view


`alt + cmd + -` - shrinks pane

`alt + cmd + =` - grows pane


#### Tree View

`cmd-shift-\` to reveal the current file in the Tree View

`Ctrl + 0` (zero) 	Toggle focus Tree View
https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/linux/Atom-(text-editor)_1.0.html _ (take off the `_)
TODO: upload PDF of shortcuts to google drive link here


#### Linter

`command (⌘) + shift + p` - brings up commands then:
`linter`
- `lint`
- `toggle`
- `toggle panel`

when turn things on and off.
