## Packages

##### [Git Diff](https://atom.io/packages/git-diff)
Tick on `Show icons in editor gutter`, which will mean you get `+`, `-` etc in colour. Rather then just lines.

#### Adding a Language
A haml file was coming up in plain text, searched for and found [`language-haml`](https://atom.io/packages/language-haml), just installed this package and all sorted.


## Shortcuts

`shft + ctrl + ↓` - will add cursor onto multiple lines, like using `cmd + click`

#### Linter

`command (⌘) + shift + p` - brings up commands then:
`linter`
- `lint`
- `toggle`
- `toggle panel`

when turn things on and off.
