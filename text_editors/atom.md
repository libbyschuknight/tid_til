##### [Git Diff](https://atom.io/packages/git-diff)
Tick on `Show icons in editor gutter`, which will mean you get `+`, `-` etc in colour. Rather then just lines.

#### Adding a Language
A haml file was coming up in plain text, searched for and found [`language-haml`](https://atom.io/packages/language-haml), just installed this package and all sorted.
