# PSQL

List databases on computer (mac - terminal)

`psql -l`

## PSQL Command line

I was wanting to see the values were in an enum column.
From here http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/tutorial-accessdb.html, I discovered:

```bash
\? for help with psql commands
```

This showed what is below.
And from that I found

```bash
\dT[S+] [PATTERN]      list data types
```

And this gave me this:

```bash
List of data types
Schema | Name | Internal name | Size |      Elements      | Owner | Access privileges | Description
--------+------+---------------+------+--------------------+-------+-------------------+-------------
public | role | role          | 4    | retailer          +| libby |                   |
			 |      |               |      | network_provider  +|       |                   |

## Finding data types

```bash
select column_name, data_type from information_schema.columns
where table_name = 'users';
```
returns
```sql
column_name |          data_type
-------------+-----------------------------
id          | bigint
name        | character varying
admin       | boolean
address     | text
city        | character varying
icp         | character varying
status      | integer
created_at  | timestamp without time zone
updated_at  | timestamp without time zone
(9 rows)
```
