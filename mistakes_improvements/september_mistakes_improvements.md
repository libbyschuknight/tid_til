# September Mistakes & Improvements

#### Issue with failed build on Travis

Updated `nokogiri`, worked fine locally, but failed on Travis with this error:

```
Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

```

Did notice this

```shell
'to_specs': Could not find 'mini_portile2' (~> 2.2.0) - did find:
[mini_portile2-2.1.0] (Gem::MissingSpecVersionError)
```

But didn't pay much attention to it.'

Asked for help on Ruby slack and got this reply:

>might need to `bundle update mini_portile2` - https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri/versions/1.8.0 depends on version `~> 2.2.0`, but it looks like according to that stack trace `2.1.0` is in your Gemfile.lock

And that was it, updated `mini_portile2` and all was good in the world!!


#### Again

Had another issue with this, when merged master in. `nokogiri` was updated. Ended up copying the `gemfile.lock` from the master branch to my feature branch and running bundle install. Which has seemed to work. It removed `pk-config` and updated both `nokogiri` and `mini_portile2`. 


#### Issue with AWS error

```
14:03:15 web.1  | Aws::SQS::Errors::InvalidClientTokenId - The security token included in the request is invalid.:
```

There were AWS credentials in the `.env` file and I added my to the `.env.development`, still got some error.

Asked a collegue and I said I thought I had come cross this error before, we searched slack for `InvalidClientTokenId` and wouldn't you know it, found this:

>So FYI for everyone else, wasnâ€™t my creds that were wrong, in the `.env.test` there were other AWS creds that were wrong! Solving meant replacing test creds with mine, which meant at present the VCR recording has my creds in. Which I will remove before pushing anything to github and I will revert the creds in  `.env.test` '

In this case it was the other creds in the `.env` file that were the probably.


### RSpec test error

When get this error:

```shell
$ bundle exec rake db:test:prepare

rake aborted!
NoMethodError: undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass
/Users/libby/code/customer_app/config/environment.rb:5:in `<top (required)>'
/Users/libby/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/bin/bundle:23:in `load'
/Users/libby/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/bin/bundle:23:in `<main>'
Tasks: TOP => db:test:prepare => environment
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
```

Was fixed by adding in a `.env.development` file.


## Merging hashes - using `inject`

Had this method, where `empty_context, account_details, contacter_details, message_content` are all hashes.

```ruby
def self.create_flick_confirmation_context(idea:)
  context = empty_context
  if idea.user
    account_details = account_details(user: idea.user)
    context = context.merge(account_details)
  else
    contacter_details = enquirer_idea_details(idea: idea)
    context = context.merge(contacter_details)
  end
  message_content = idea_content(idea: idea)
  context.merge(message_content)
end
```

Was looking at this to refactor (after writing specs) and looked up how to merge multiple hashes:

https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/620405

```ruby
a = [{:first => 1, :second => 2}, {:first => 10, :third => 3}]
a.inject(:merge)
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19548496/how-to-merge-multiple-hashes-in-ruby

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18329633/how-to-merge-multiple-hashes

http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject

Had a play in the console and then updated code to:

```ruby
def self.create_flick_confirmation_context(idea:)
  context = [empty_context, enquirer_contact_details(idea: idea), idea_content(idea: idea)]
  context.inject(:merge)
end
```

With a new method to deal with the enquirer details:

```ruby
def self.enquirer_contact_details(idea:)
  if idea.user
    account_details(user: idea.user)
  else
    enquirer_idea_details(idea: idea)
  end
end
```

And refactored to:

```ruby
def self.enquirer_contact_details(idea:)
  return account_details(user: idea.user) if idea.user
  enquirer_idea_details(idea: idea)
end
```

Handy having specs written, as was easy to make sure that changes were not changing the behaviour.

Reference:

```ruby
def self.empty_context
  {
    subject: "",
    body_text: "",
    name: "",
    email_address: "",
    phone_number: "",
    account_number: ""
  }
end

def self.account_details(user:)
  {
    name: user.preferred_name,
    email_address: user.email,
    account_number: user.default_account.account_number
  }
end

def self.enquirer_idea_details(idea:)
  {
    name: idea.name,
    email_address: idea.email_address,
    phone_number: idea.phone_number
  }
end

def self.idea_content(idea:)
  {
    subject: idea.subject_label,
    body_text: idea.body
  }
end
```
