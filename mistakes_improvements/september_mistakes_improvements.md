# September Mistakes & Improvements

#### Issue with failed build on Travis

Updated `nokogiri`, worked fine locally, but failed on Travis with this error:

```shell
Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
current directory:
/home/travis/build/FlickElectric/customer_app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/nokogiri-1.8.0/ext/nokogiri

```

Did notice this

```shell
'to_specs': Could not find 'mini_portile2' (~> 2.2.0) - did find:
[mini_portile2-2.1.0] (Gem::MissingSpecVersionError)
```

But didn't pay much attention to it.'

Asked for help on Ruby slack and got this reply:

>might need to `bundle update mini_portile2` - https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri/versions/1.8.0 depends on version `~> 2.2.0`, but it looks like according to that stack trace `2.1.0` is in your Gemfile.lock

And that was it, updated `mini_portile2` and all was good in the world!!


#### Issue with AWS error

```
14:03:15 web.1  | Aws::SQS::Errors::InvalidClientTokenId - The security token included in the request is invalid.:
```

There were AWS credentials in the `.env` file and I added my to the `.env.development`, still got some error.

Asked a collegue and I said I thought I had come cross this error before, we searched slack for `InvalidClientTokenId` and wouldn't you know it, found this:

>So FYI for everyone else, wasnâ€™t my creds that were wrong, in the `.env.test` there were other AWS creds that were wrong! Solving meant replacing test creds with mine, which meant at present the VCR recording has my creds in. Which I will remove before pushing anything to github and I will revert the creds in  `.env.test` '

In this case it was the other creds in the `.env` file that were the probably.


### RSpec test error

When get this error:

```shell
$ bundle exec rake db:test:prepare

rake aborted!
NoMethodError: undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass
/Users/libby/code/customer_app/config/environment.rb:5:in `<top (required)>'
/Users/libby/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/bin/bundle:23:in `load'
/Users/libby/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/bin/bundle:23:in `<main>'
Tasks: TOP => db:test:prepare => environment
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
```

Was fixed by adding in a `.env.development` file.
