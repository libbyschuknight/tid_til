## [Semantic code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/#semantics-overview)

>Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content. There are several benefits to using semantic elements, including enabling computers, screen readers, search engines, and other devices to adequately read and understand the content on a web page. Additionally, semantic HTML is easier to manage and work with, as it shows clearly what each piece of content is about.

>Divisions, or <div>s, and <span>s are HTML elements that act as containers solely for styling purposes.
