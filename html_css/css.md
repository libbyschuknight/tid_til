## Basic stuff
Used this site to work on creating a button that I wanted. Was keen to have a bigger button then the defaults seem to give - http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp

## Truncating

Had a long file name ` FLCK_E_FLCK_YINVHDR_201610_20170828_095206_19700101000000.csv` and when making the page smaller, got it overlapping with other text, so doing the below, got ` FLCK_E_FLCK_YINVHDR_201610_2017...` and no overlapping! üòÅ

```css
.truncate {
  width: 250px;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

And in my case added `padding-right: 2em;`, as had another class adding `width: 35%;`, which was overriding the `width: 250px;` and I wanted some white space on the right.
