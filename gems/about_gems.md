### [inherited_resources](https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources)
This gem I came across in a big legacy codebase. It is used when you don't want to write lots of controller actions over and over.
> Inherited Resources speeds up development by making your controllers inherit all restful actions so you just have to focus on what is important. It makes your controllers more powerful and cleaner at the same time.

Good to know about this as I wasn't sure what was happening with the controller I was trying to do stuff in.


### To see what versions of gems have
e.g. to see what different versions of rails you have logically

```
gem list
...
rails (5.0.1, 5.0.0.1, 4.2.7.1, 4.2.6, 4.2.5.1, 4.2.5, 4.2.3, 4.2.1, 4.2.0, 3.2.15)
rails-deprecated_sanitizer (1.0.3)
rails-dom-testing (2.0.2, 2.0.1, 1.0.8, 1.0.7, 1.0.6)
