# tid_til
> Today I Did & Today I Learnt

A collation of [what I have done](tid.md) each day at work and what I have learnt while coding.
As well as [meet ups, courses, conferences](courses_etc.md) and other things I have been too.
Plus [questions](questions.md) that come up for me as I am coding. The aim will be to overtime, answer these!
There are many terms in coding/development/computer science that I don't know you, so there is also a [terms](terms.md) section.
