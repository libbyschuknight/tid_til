### Thoughts on writing cukes

`Given I am on the game page - correct guess`

>Possibly `Given I am ready to play a turn` as this contains no implementation specific language.
>Most of the following steps have implementation details (e.g. click a button). Cukes should describe intent of the action (submit my guess).
