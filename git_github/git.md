# Git

### Useful Resources
[Getting Started](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository) - have come across this again and again and it has always been useful.

[git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

[Little Things I Like to Do with Git](https://csswizardry.com/2017/05/little-things-i-like-to-do-with-git/)


##### git fetch
Rather than pulling down a branch, which does a `fetch` and a `merge`, I have stared doing:
```bash
git fetch origin <branch_name>

git checkout <branch_name>
```

In some cases pulling can cause problems. Will add why when I come across it again!

##### git branch
List branches by committer date instead of alphabetically:

`git branch --sort=-committerdate`


##### git clean
Quite often I have found that I have had to get rid of untracked files in git and have discovered that git clean is something that you can use.

```bash
git clean -n # performs a dry run, will show you what will be removed
git clean -f # actually removes files
```

##### git revert / reset
This has been useful when I have be zealot like with merging in master to my branch and then discovering that a change someone else has made gives me problems, like breaking tests. So, I have used git revert to go back to my last commit.

```bash
git revert 3333333333 # commit number
```

Actually, while writing this I have realized I actually did a git reset.

```bash
git reset 3333333333 # commit number
```
Which probably wasn't the best option for me and a git revert would have been more appropriate.

Wanted to go back a few commits that had already been pushed up. So reset to commit and then did a force push to branch.

```bash
git reset --hard <commit>

git push -f <remote> <branch>

e.g.
git push --force origin bugfix/squash_it
```

Issue had with local repo:
- did a `git pull branch`, then `git merge master`
- resolved conflicts that came up
- some how had one file that had all of its code missing, it was the most recent file
- to fix did:
    `git pull -f origin branch`
    `git reset --hard origin/branch`



##### searching commits

```bash
git log --all --grep="#til"
```


##### tags - deleting

If you have pushed a tag and then released that you had the wrong number, you can do this:
```bash
git tag -d v1.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0
```
from [How do I remove or delete a tag from a Git repo?](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/how-do-i-remove-or-delete-a-tag-from-a-git-repo-282175551.html), even though it is on a BitBUcket page, it works for GitHub too (I guess as it is in git).


### remotes

Check what what remotes are on a repo:

- `git branch -a` => shows branches and remotes including `gem_fury`

- `git branch -r` => just shows remotes


### `git add <file1> <file2>`

I'm not sure why it has taken me a long time to click onto this, it maybe because I have always added EVERYTHING before adding, committing and pushing. Which has gotten me into some tricky spots!
So,

`git add .`

adds everything.

But you can add one file at a time

`git add <file`>

or two or more files

`git add <file1> <file2>`

Perhaps also as I am using OhMyZsh and being using the git [cheatsheet](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet#git) I have taken the easy/lazy road of just always adding everything.
I had better start using `ga` (shortcut for `git add`) when wanting to not add all files.

### Checking out a branches `tag` / version

```bash
git checkout 4.4.0
```
Instead of a branch name you will see the first few digits of the tags commit shard.
You will get something like this:

```bash
Note: checking out '4.4.0'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 3768438... Tag version 4.4.0
```
Make a new branch so any changes you make can be kept:
```bash
git branch -d feature/participant_roles_facade
```
Apply anything you have stashed - `git stash apply`

(see [Gem Stuff](gems/gem_stuff.md) for example of when used)


### `git log` plus variations
I use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and `zsh` instead of `bash`.
I use the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet) as well, which has [a lot of `git`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet#git) aliases set up.

One that I have just found useful is:
```bash
#alias     #command
glg	      git log --stat --max-count = 10
```
This shows the files that have been committed, which can be useful if the commit message hasn't been written that well!


### git stash
how to see what you have stashed
```bash
git stash list
git stash show -p
git stash show -p stash@{3}
```

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3573623/is-it-possible-to-preview-stash-contents-in-git

And then to put back into the branch the stash you want:

`git stash apply stash@{3}`

`apply` keeps the stash, `pop` takes it of the stack (gets rid of it)

To get rid of a stash:

`git stash drop`  removes top one
`git stash drop stash@{3}` specific one

Stash untacked files:
`git stash -u`
>Adding the -u option (or --include-untracked) tells git stash to also stash your untracked files:

### git rebase

```bash
feature/first_page_form

git rebase feature/form

git push --force origin feature/first_page_join_form_MVP
```

[Getting solid at Git rebase vs. merge](https://medium.com/@porteneuve/getting-solid-at-git-rebase-vs-merge-4fa1a48c53aa#.9yty645zl)

### git reset
When have mucked up a merge or something badly and need to reset the branch. Or in this case want to reset the uat branch locally to what is on github.

```bash
git checkout uat

git fetch origin uat

git reset --hard origin/uat
```

#### git reset --soft HEAD^
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12481639/remove-files-from-git-commit

When you have made a commit and then realise there are heaps of files in it that shouldn't be!

`git reset --soft HEAD^`

Then reset the unwanted files in order to leave them out from the commit:

`git reset HEAD path/to/unwanted_file`

`git reset HEAD test/`    # remove all the files under test that didn't want to add

Now commit again, you can even re-use the same commit message:

`git commit -c ORIG_HEAD`


### git commits
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

>**The seven rules of a great git commit message**

>Keep in mind: This has all been said before.
Separate subject from body with a blank line
Limit the subject line to 50 characters
Capitalize the subject line
Do not end the subject line with a period
Use the imperative mood in the subject line
Wrap the body at 72 characters
Use the body to explain what and why vs. how


##### Amending a commit

If you have made some changes and just want to add them to the last commit you made.

Remember to `git add .` the changes

```bash
git commit --amend  # this will allow you to also change the commit message

git commit -a
```

if you want to add files or changes without editing the message

```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

## Find most recent branches
Canâ€™t remember what branches are most recently active in a repo without using Github?
Use `git branch --sort=-authordate`
and the most recently changed branches will be listed at the top.
Thanks @ootovak


## Adding a remote to a local repo
Needed to do this when I created a Rails app but then realised I hadn't used postgres or taken out test unit and turbolinks. I had already created a github repo so there was already a remote.
I deleted my first repo locally and then create new app, then added the remote.

`git remote add origin git@github.com:libbyschuknight/go_surf.git`

`git remote -v`


## Go back to previous branch - quickly
```bash
git checkout -
```

## Issue with pushing to github

Started working in a repo I haven't been in for ages and when pushing kept getting this:

`Enter passphrase for key '/Users/libby/.ssh/id_rsa':`

enter password and all is good with that world...until next time, need to repeat.

So, have tried doing

`ssh-add`,

this gives `Enter passphrase for /Users/libby/.ssh/id_rsa:`,

enter password and then:

`Identity added: /Users/libby/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/libby/.ssh/id_rsa)`

Hoping this has fixed it!
