# API Stuff

#### Semantic Versioning
- [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)

>You are not fixing a bug, so not the last position.

>You are not breaking an existing API, so not first position.

>You are adding a new feature, so middle position.

>For APIs also if it is not a new API endpoint I try to think if it will break any existing apps using the endpoint. If you are adding attributes that should be safe (and be a minor bump as well) but if you are removing or changing any attributes then it is a breaking change and it is a major change.

>And if you are changing any URLs if it doesnâ€™t redirect to an endpoint that returns the same thing an app would have got before it is also a breaking change.
