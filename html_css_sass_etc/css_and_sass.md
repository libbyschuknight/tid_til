## CSS-Tricks

Good site, need to explore - <https://css-tricks.com/>

It has:

## Basic stuff

Used this site to work on creating a button that I wanted. Was keen to have a bigger button then the defaults seem to give - <http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp>

Will add code when completed, and images.

### !important

## Truncating

Had a long file name `FLCK_E_FLCK_YINVHDR_201610_20170828_095206_19700101000000.csv` and when making the page smaller, got it overlapping with other text, so doing the below, got `FLCK_E_FLCK_YINVHDR_201610_2017...` and no overlapping! 😁

```css
.truncate {
  width: 250px;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

And in my case added `padding-right: 2em;`, as had another class adding `width: 35%;`, which was overriding the `width: 250px;` and I wanted some white space on the right.

### Default Values - `!default`

<https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables#default-values>

>Normally when you assign a value to a variable, if that variable already had a value, its old value is overwritten. But if you’re writing a Sass library, you might want to allow your users to customize your library’s variables before you use them to generate CSS.
>
>To make this possible, Sass provides the !default flag. This assigns a value to a variable only if that variable isn’t defined or its value is null. Otherwise, the existing value will be used. This way, users can set variables before they import your library to customize its behavior.
