### Talks
[#goodwithpicles](https://twitter.com/goodwithpixels) Talks on Code - speaker series
23 March 2016
THE STORYTELLER AND THE TEACHER
> Rob Appierdo, Creative Director of Storybox, will show us behind-the-scenes work on their latest project. The Woman Who Forgot is a multi-dimensional theatre piece combining the physical space around the CBD, a smartphone app, and live performers of the NZ Arts Festival. Rob will be joined by Project Director Jess Feast and Lead Developer Joe Dixon.
Vanessa Brennan, Software Development Manager at BNZ Digital, will give us a run down on what the next generation of developers might look like with Code Club Aotearoa. Code Club is a nation-wide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for kiwi kids. Vanessa will touch on what this might mean for the future of development, and how a diverse code-literate generation positively influences our collective futures.

Storybox talk was really interesting. Its exciting to hear about how tech and creativity cross over. Would be great to get this information into schools and particularly share with secondary schools students (mostly girls), so they can really see they technology is not just geeky and science-y and maths-y but it can also be full on creative.
Code Club talk - was hoping to hear more about the plans of getting a code club going at BNZ.

### Meet Ups

##### [Wellington Wagtail CMS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Wagtail-CMS-Meetup/events/230329388/) - 27 April 2016
> We're excited to announce the first Wagtail CMS meetup in New Zealand!

> Wagtail (https://wagtail.io) is an open source CMS (Content Management System) created by Torchbox. Built on top of the well-known Django Web Framework, it's extremely developer friendly while it also offers a great interface for content editors. Content can be created and structured intuitively thanks to its fast attractive interface. Here at Springload we have been using it for almost 2 years it has become a crucial piece of our technology stack.

> This session will be conducted by some of the dev folks at Springload:

>• Josh Barr – Front-end director (@joshbarrnz)

>• Jordi J. Tablada – Senior dev (@jordijoan81)

>• Rich McMillan – Technical director (@knersis)

>They will showcase the main features Wagtail has to offer. There will be demo website, live coding, community involvement and of course food and drinks provided by Springload.

Thought this was a great meetup. They went through things well. Particularly for someone who only knows a little bit about Python and nothing about Django or any other frameworks used in the Python world.
I may have enjoyed as I love the UI of Wagtail. I am looking forward to playing with this in the near future.


##### [Modules and basic PHP](http://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Stripe-Girls/events/229981904/) - 13 April 2016
> - Checking out Silverstripe modules. See how to install them, and review a few nice once to have.
- Lena taught us logic last time, we are going to use it! PHP intro to beginners.
- Workshop. Apply what we learned :)
The format is not yet decided. We can either have talks (with slides and all that) first and then on the workshop start coding. Or we can not have formal talks, just peer (group) programming from the beginning. If you have a preference for one, please leave a comment, otherwise we are going to decide before the meetup :)

Was interesting learning about 'modules', which are basically Ruby 'gems', or very similar. 'Composer' is like 'bundler' in Ruby. Have better understanding of what SilverStripe is and what it is used for.


##### [Railsn00bs v13](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonRailsn00bs/events/229809896/) - 2 April 2016
> In the mood to learn something new? Andrew Kampjes will host a mini workshop on security for Ruby on Rails. In this interactive session, you'll get a chance to try your hand at making things more secure!

Interesting to learn about some simple security issues that it is important to keep in mind.

##### [Moving from Heroku to AWS](http://www.meetup.com/wellrailed/events/228618853/?comment_table_id=462563895&comment_table_name=event_comment) - 16 March 2016
> First up with have Mathew Hartley. Over Christmas Storypark moved from Heroku over to Elastic Beanstalk (and changed regions in the process). Learn what you need to know to perform this migration in production and then immediately escape on a three-week holiday. Mathew leads up the technical side of Storypark, which involves coding, delegating, and trying to minimise sys-admin time. He’s a friendly Ruby developer and has been for several years now.


Good talk to go to. A lot of it over my head but understand more than I thought I might have. Good networking. Got some good links for devops from Tanya.

> Nick and Rachel talk from a team member and delivery team lead's point of view about their team's journey in collaboration over the last year.

##### [Railsn00bs v11](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonRailsn00bs/events/228576127/) - 13 Feb 2016
> This meetup, we will be joined by two amazing speakers, Raquel Moss and Michael Fowler, who will present short lightning talks exploring the world of tech and beyond.

Raquel gave a good presentation on ["Continuing your learning as a post-beginner programmer"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mvzT2qCm5_MoJrojKx5VLUU4zH_LyL83UjPqOlugYw8/edit#slide=id.p). I liked having a standard app that you you build and an app that you add to. I am aiming to work on making something I add to at the moment. I would like to have an app I rebuild in different languages but other then a blog I'm not sure what I would do, so holding off.

##### [Railsn00bs v10](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonRailsn00bs/events/227108293/) - 12 Dec 2015
> This time, Taylor Lodge will be speaking about React, and how you can get started using it with Rails and Lena Plaksina will be talking about her experiences coming to programming from an arts background.


##### [Railsn00bs v6](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonRailsn00bs/events/224840301/) - 5 Sept 2015
> This time, we'll be having a pitch session for community projects. Start thinking about what you want to build, and come along and tell us about it. Pitches will be 2 minutes, no slides. We will also have a live Intro to Rails for anyone that is just getting started.

##### [ORMs && WebMachine](http://www.meetup.com/wellrailed/events/224603668/) - 25 Aug 2015

##### [Starting out with established codebases](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/224321241/) - 17 Aug 2015

> As nice as it is to build a project from scratch, the reality is that most of the time you will be dealing with existing code. A *lot* of existing code. Hundreds of thousands of lines of it, touched by a bunch of different developers, over several years.
This session will help you form strategies for that inevitable moment where you're faced with a well-established codebase - when you're starting a new job, investigating an obscure part of your application that no one touches, or debugging a third party library to work out why it's behaving the way it is. It will also cover ways you can contribute to the code even while learning how it works, building confidence in an unfamiliar codebase at the same time.

##### [Proposing Your First Conference Talk with Guest Speaker Carina C. Zona](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/223571001/) - 20 July 2015

> Giving conference talks is a game changer. Speaking can propel a career forward, expand your network considerably, and lead to wonderfully surprising opportunities.
You get to learn and be inspired, as well as share. You get free tickets to a conference you may never have been able to attend another way. Some also pay for travel, lodging, and/or honorarium.
As a speaker, you get to have lively conversations with peers and idols, about the topics that most fascinate you personally.
At this Enspiral Dev Academy/Rails Girls workshop, you'll get practical skills for doing your first proposal:
• how to find relevant opportunities
• dissecting calls for proposals (CFPs)
• evaluating CFPs for fit with you
• questions it's cool to ask organizers
• the darned fair expectations to hold
• brainstorming a topic
• writing the abstract

##### [Who owns all that data?](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/221801498/) - 29 April 2015

> Drew from Common Ledger will talk through his interesting run-ins with data access, data ownership, data custody, a $20M lawsuit and ways to avoid this - particularly around the API space. While he adds the disclaimer IANAL, there is educated and scarred truths of reality in this talk that will hopefully help you educate yourself in the world of the "Internet of Things".

##### [Everything I wish someone had told me about being an IT graduate](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/220002585/) - 11 Feb 2015

> It turns out that almost everyone who's new to being a developer has largely the same fears, worries and concerns about their first job - and it's never what you expect. Xero's Hannah Gray helps us debunk some of the myths, break through the jargon around career paths and tell you what a job as a junior developer will really be about.

##### [What we're learning and what the industry is doing](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/218883287/) - 26 Nov 2014

> We've got Ben and Dan from Xero this week. Dan has worked with some familiar names in Wellington IT and now works at Xero, building features and improving code in one of the core teams. Ben has been working with Microsoft technologies for around 15 years. After a stint teaching at Dev Academy earlier this year he is now also at Xero, looking after some of the developers and talking about code quality.
They're going to talk about the similarities and differences techniques between and tools Dev Academy students are learning and the ones that firms like Xero are using.

##### [A whirlwind tour of how computers work](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/217487932/) - 5 Nov 2014

> This talk will be a whirlwind tour of what's going on under the covers in computers.  It will start from transistors, and build up to logic gates, state machines, instruction sets, machine code, assembly language and up to high level programming languages and frameworks.  Obviously we'll be skipping a lot of detail, but the goal will be to demystify how computers work by building up from simple things to increasingly complex things in layers that can be understood separately.

##### [“A Day in the Life”](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/205111522/) - 4 Oct 2014

> Join us for a chance to really feel what it’s like to be a boot at our nine-week programming academy. We will walk you through the paces so you get an honest taste of what cohort members learn, feel and become.
During the day you will launch right into coding fundamentals and we will challenge you based on your experience. You’ll be pairing (coding in pairs) with other “boots” just like our cohorts do and we’ll also explore lots of other programming ideas and concepts.
In order to produce the well balanced programmers that we do we will also be focusing on emotional intelligence and wellbeing. We will make use of the yoga space and may try our hand at some meditation. This is everything you can expect to see daily at Dev Academy, so we’re making sure you get to try it all too!

This was a great day to go to. Helped me decided to take the plunge to change careers.
