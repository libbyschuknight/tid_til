> First up with have Mathew Hartley. Over Christmas Storypark moved from Heroku over to Elastic Beanstalk (and changed regions in the process). Learn what you need to know to perform this migration in production and then immediately escape on a three-week holiday. Mathew leads up the technical side of Storypark, which involves coding, delegating, and trying to minimise sys-admin time. Heâ€™s a friendly Ruby developer and has been for several years now.

##### [Starting out with established codebases](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/224321241/) - 17 Aug 2016
Janella Espinas - @fakeamerican
> As nice as it is to build a project from scratch, the reality is that most of the time you will be dealing with existing code. A *lot* of existing code. Hundreds of thousands of lines of it, touched by a bunch of different developers, over several years.
This session will help you form strategies for that inevitable moment where you're faced with a well-established codebase - when you're starting a new job, investigating an obscure part of your application that no one touches, or debugging a third party library to work out why it's behaving the way it is. It will also cover ways you can contribute to the code even while learning how it works, building confidence in an unfamiliar codebase at the same time.
