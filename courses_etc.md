Interesting to learn about some simple security issues that it is important to keep in mind.

##### [Moving from Heroku to AWS](http://www.meetup.com/wellrailed/events/228618853/?comment_table_id=462563895&comment_table_name=event_comment) - 16 March 2016
> First up with have Mathew Hartley. Over Christmas Storypark moved from Heroku over to Elastic Beanstalk (and changed regions in the process). Learn what you need to know to perform this migration in production and then immediately escape on a three-week holiday. Mathew leads up the technical side of Storypark, which involves coding, delegating, and trying to minimise sys-admin time. He’s a friendly Ruby developer and has been for several years now.


Good talk to go to. A lot of it over my head but understand more than I thought I might have. Good networking. Got some good links for devops from Tanya.

##### [Tales from Team Taniwha's Den](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/228094908/) - 15 Feb 2016
Nick Johnstone / Rachel Colleridge
>Telling the story of an agile delivery team from birth to maturity - what we found out, what went well and how we had a LOT of fun while doing it.
> Nick and Rachel talk from a team member and delivery team lead's point of view about their team's journey in collaboration over the last year.

##### [Railsn00bs v11](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonRailsn00bs/events/228576127/) - 13 Feb 2016
> This meetup, we will be joined by two amazing speakers, Raquel Moss and Michael Fowler, who will present short lightning talks exploring the world of tech and beyond.

Raquel gave a good presentation on ["Continuing your learning as a post-beginner programmer"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mvzT2qCm5_MoJrojKx5VLUU4zH_LyL83UjPqOlugYw8/edit#slide=id.p). I liked having a standard app that you you build and an app that you add to. I am aiming to work on making something I add to at the moment. I would like to have an app I rebuild in different languages but other then a blog I'm not sure what I would do, so holding off.

##### [Railsn00bs v10](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonRailsn00bs/events/227108293/) - 12 Dec 2015

##### [Starting out with established codebases](http://www.meetup.com/Enspiral-Dev-Academy-Meetup/events/224321241/) - 17 Aug 2015

> As nice as it is to build a project from scratch, the reality is that most of the time you will be dealing with existing code. A *lot* of existing code. Hundreds of thousands of lines of it, touched by a bunch of different developers, over several years.
This session will help you form strategies for that inevitable moment where you're faced with a well-established codebase - when you're starting a new job, investigating an obscure part of your application that no one touches, or debugging a third party library to work out why it's behaving the way it is. It will also cover ways you can contribute to the code even while learning how it works, building confidence in an unfamiliar codebase at the same time.

### Talks
[#goodwithpicles](https://twitter.com/goodwithpixels) Talks on Code - speaker series
23 March 2016
THE STORYTELLER AND THE TEACHER
> Rob Appierdo, Creative Director of Storybox, will show us behind-the-scenes work on their latest project. The Woman Who Forgot is a multi-dimensional theatre piece combining the physical space around the CBD, a smartphone app, and live performers of the NZ Arts Festival. Rob will be joined by Project Director Jess Feast and Lead Developer Joe Dixon.
Vanessa Brennan, Software Development Manager at BNZ Digital, will give us a run down on what the next generation of developers might look like with Code Club Aotearoa. Code Club is a nation-wide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for kiwi kids. Vanessa will touch on what this might mean for the future of development, and how a diverse code-literate generation positively influences our collective futures.

Storybox talk was really interesting. Its exciting to hear about how tech and creativity cross over. Would be great to get this information into schools and particularly share with secondary schools students (mostly girls), so they can really see they technology is not just geeky and science-y and maths-y but it can also be full on creative.
Code Club talk - was hoping to hear more about the plans of getting a code club going at BNZ.
